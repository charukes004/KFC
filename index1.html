        <p class="para">KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders (1890–1980), an entrepreneur who began selling fried
            chicken from
            his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders identified the potential
            of the restaurant franchising concept and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Salt Lake
            City, Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by
            challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders", Harland
            became a prominent figure of American cultural history and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising
            to this day. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and he sold it to a group
            of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964.</p>
